You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

When /^I visit the marineby\.com home page$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see the title bar$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Then /^I should see the title description$/ do
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
